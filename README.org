#+DATE: [2024-10-15 22:07]

In 2024, I spent three months on it: July, Augest and September. It can render
simple OBJ format 3D model.To give it a try, you need to install VS2022 on your
PC, then compile and run it. I provide some models in the =models= folder.

To get more information, please goto =doc= folder and check ORG or HTML documentation,
I provide both English and Chinese versions.
